The above project is a simple frame selling e-commerce site which is still under development.

How to run:
On the terminal run nodemon .\server.js(needs nodemon to be installed) or node .\server.js
Access (http://localhost:3000/) on the browser and click login if a customer or select 'admin' option to upload a picture to the db.
As an admin, you will need a password, you can find it in the queries.sql file line 17
The db is however local hence uploading might not work unless you have the db locally
